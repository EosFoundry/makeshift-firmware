# MakeShift Firmware

This is the code that runs on the MakeShift device itself to read button inputs, control LEDs, and run the UI on the display.

The MakeShift is built on top of the [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html)

# Installing or Updating firmware

The easiest way to install firmware right now is through getting a .HEX file and uploading it with the Teensy Loader tool that comes bundled with [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)

Things you will have installed by the end:

- Arduino IDE
- Teensyduino

## Windows

### 1. Installing Teensyduino

Follow the installation instructions from the official website - https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html 

### 2. Get the latest HEX file

The latest releases can be found on the side bar or on the [releases page](https://github.com/EosFoundry/makeshift-firmware/releases)

### 3. Use the Teensy Loader to upload the HEX file



# Building the Firmware from Source Code

Getting the code and building it is a little more involved and requires setting up Platformio. This project uses [Platformio](https://platformio.org/) to manage all its dependencies and builds. If you're more comfortable with a UI-based building process, the easiest way is to get the [Platformio IDE](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) for Visual Studio Code.

## Using Visual Studio Code with the Platformio IDE

## Linux




## Windows


## MacOS
